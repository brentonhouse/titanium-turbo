styles              your style (.tss) files for your views go here
assets              All files here will be deployed into Resources
lib                 put your own libraries here and use require('@/name') to load it
migrations          generated model migrations go here
widgets             pre-built, reusable components for your Alloy apps.

Also, in the root is the config.json, this file is where you can declare runtime constants, and widget dependencies.
